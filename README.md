# Data_Processing_Price_Calculation
## ‚úÖ Overview 
This project demonstrates basic data preprocessing techniques using a dataset of car prices. It explores statistical measures such as **mean, median, mode, quartiles, interquartile range (IQR)**, and **skewness**, and visualizes data distribution to  identify patterns and anomalies effectively.

---

## ‚úÖ Why Is This Important?  
Understanding car price distribution helps in identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and making data-driven decisions.  
- **Skewness Analysis:** Reveals whether most cars are priced affordably or expensively.  
- **Outlier Detection:** Identifies unusually priced cars, useful for pricing strategies and market analysis.

## ‚úÖ Project Structure  

1. **Data Analysis:**  
   - Calculate mean, median, mode, IQR, and skewness of car prices.  
   - Detect outliers based on statistical measures.  

2. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Visualize the distribution of car prices using histograms.  
   - Compare symmetric, positively skewed, and negatively skewed distributions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Code
Install Required Libraries
```bash

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
Open Jupyter Notebook
Navigate to the folder where the Data preprocessing.ipynb file is stored, and open the notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Running the Notebook

Once Jupyter opens in your browser, click on the notebook file Data preprocessing.ipynb.

Run each cell to execute the preprocessing steps and see the results.

‚úÖ **Applications:** 

Market Analysis: Identifying outliers helps set competitive pricing.

Data Cleaning: Detecting anomalies improves data accuracy.

Business Insights: Understanding price distribution aids in strategic decision-making.

**Code Explanation:**

The code is broken down into several key sections to guide you through the preprocessing process:

**Importing Libraries**

All necessary libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, are imported at the beginning. These libraries help in manipulating the data, handling missing values, performing statistical calculations, and visualizing the results.

**Loading the Dataset**

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. If you have a custom dataset, you can easily replace this step with loading your own file.

**Handling Missing Data**



The notebook demonstrates how to identify and handle missing values in your dataset.

You can either remove rows with missing values or fill them with appropriate methods (e.g., mean, median, or mode imputation).

Feature Scaling

Scaling ensures that numerical features are on a similar scale, making it easier for machine learning algorithms to work with the data.

Techniques like standardization (z-score normalization) and normalization (scaling features to a range) are applied.

**Outlier Detection**

Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations. They can be identified using methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-scores.

This section highlights how to detect and handle outliers to prevent skewing analysis or models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Basic visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots) are used to understand the distribution of data and highlight potential issues such as skewness or the presence of outliers.**

üöÄ**Key Concepts in Data Preprocessing**

Missing Data: Missing values in a dataset can affect the accuracy of your analysis. It's important to fill them appropriately or remove them entirely.

Feature Scaling: Rescaling features ensures that all variables contribute equally to machine learning algorithms, improving their performance.

Outliers: Identifying and handling outliers is crucial for building accurate models since they can distort results.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA helps you understand your data better by visualizing distributions and relationships among features.

üìä **Data Visualizations**

The notebook includes visualizations such as:

Histograms to observe the distribution of numerical data.

Boxplots to visualize the spread of data and detect outliers.

Pair plots (if applicable) to explore relationships between features.

These plots are essential in EDA to understand the data and ensure it‚Äôs ready for further processing or modeling.

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** 

Outliers significantly affect the mean, making it less reliable for skewed data.

Skewness analysis reveals pricing trends, helping to identify affordable or expensive car segments.

Data visualization makes it easier to identify patterns and anomalies at a glance.

Data preprocessing is a critical step in the data science workflow. By the end of this notebook, you will have a cleaned and transformed dataset that is ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks. Key steps include handling missing values, scaling features, detecting outliers, and performing exploratory data analysis.
